For autoconnect to ws chat here must store settings.config file with this format:
USERNAME = "your_username"
WSCHATURL = "your_wschaturl"
If you do not have this "settings.config", when you run ```npm run start``` will be displayed that you do not have settings for chat and must answer a couple of questions. After this questions "settings.config" will be created with your preferences and stored in settings/settings.config.
